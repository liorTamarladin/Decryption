Subject(s): language models, n-grams, simulated annealing
* language model.py: containing the functionality needed in order to read a corpus from
an online resource and build an n-gram language model (in particular, a bigram language model)
using that corpus.
* permutation.py: representing a letter permutation, according to the description below.
* simulated annealing.py: containing an implementation of the simulated annealing algorithm for finding the optimal hypothesis in a large conjecture space.
* main.py: connecting all the logical parts that have been described so far.
